Wumpus-World
=============


In this project I used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_order_logic" target="_blank"><font color="#ff4500"><b>first order logic</b></font></a> to implement a logical agent to play the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wumpus_world" target="_blank"><font color="#ff4500"><b>wumpus world game</b></font></a>. I did this by building a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base" target="_blank"><font color="#ff4500"><b>knowledge base</b></font></a> of rules and information about the wumpus world. I then used an inference method to query my knowledge base using the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/otterapi/" target="_blank"><font color="#ff4500"><b>Otter Api</b></font></a> before each move was made by the logical agent. I tested this logical agent by designing and using a text based version of the wumpus world game using the Lisp programming language in the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" target="_blank"><font color="#ff45002"><b>GNU Emacs</b></font></a> Integrated developers Environment. This project was developed for an artificial intelligence class and developed further after class requirements were met.<br>


I have included a zip file in this repository containing all the source code files for the program, a read-me file, a proposal for the project as well as printed output from running the program.
